# Daily-Planner

Hello and welcome to the Daily Planner, this planner allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.


## How It Works.
* When the planner is opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
* When you scroll down you'll see time blocks for standard business hours from 9a.m to 5p.m
* Each time block is color-coded to the time of the day, past, present, or future.

* The user can click into a time block and enter an event.
* When the user clicks on the save button on the right of that time block, then the text for that event is saved in localStorage.
* When the page is refreshed, the saved events persist on the website.
